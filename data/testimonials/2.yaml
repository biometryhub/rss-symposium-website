text: "I am interested in collaborations on three themes: 1) research on robust statistical methods, in particular the theory of rank methods, 2) research in food sensometrics, outside the consumer research, 3) applied statistics research in application to agriculture and food data. Highlights and delights of my career were several papers on rank methods followed my PhD in 2006; establishing a Food Sensory Research Unit in the University of Queensland in 2011 and collaborating for more than a decade with researchers in medical, biological and agriculture sciences. Currently I am leading a large project funded by the Grains Research and Development Corporation, Statistics for the  Australian Grains Industry in Southern Region, SAGI-STH."
