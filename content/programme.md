        Reading slowly McIntyre's original paper [Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 3:385-390, 1952] highlights the reasons for slow adoption of the ranked set sampling in agriculture and environment field practice and suggests ways of engaging biology researchers in a dialogue leading to a mutually productive extension of the RSS practice.

        When McIntyre first proposed the innovative idea of ranked set sampling in 1952, I doubt that he had any idea of the impact it would eventually have on the field of statistical inference. There was a flurry of statistical activity immediately following his seminal paper, including derivation of some basic properties of mean estimation based on ranked set samples, and there were scattered applications of the methodology. However, it would take another thirty years of virtual dormancy in the field before the spark from Stokes and Sager (1988) would reignite interest in this novel approach to sampling. Additional methodological papers followed fast and furious and active research in the field continues today.
In this talk we briefly discuss these early efforts, but our emphasis will be on the general structure of ranked set sampling and the unique properties of statistical procedures utilizing RSS data. Seldom has a statistical concept/idea presented itself with so many interesting and unique opportunities for methodological development. In the second part of the presentation, we highlight the special features and attributes of RSS that lead to both its flexibility and its effectiveness, as well as address a few issues of concern when using this approach to sampling. We then briefly discuss a number of statistical settings where RSS procedures have been studied. In the final part of the talk, we describe some RSS-inspired offshoots that have also led to substantial research development. The full extent of the impact on statistical methodology that McIntyre inspired in 1952 is yet to be realized.

        In this talk, we will consider design based inference in finite populations and experimental designs.  In finite population setting, we construct probability proportional-to-size (pps) ranked-set and judgment-post-stratified sampling designs. These sampling designs select the units with selection probabilities proportional to their size and then induces further stratification based on their relative positions in a small comparison set.  Hence, the information content of the samples are increased by inducing additional structure in the sample based on their position information in the comparison sets and the use of unequal selection probabilities.  We extend the pps-ranked-set (ppsrs) and pps-judgment-post-stratifed (ppsj) sampling designs to stratified populations, and construct unbiased estimators for the population mean, total, and their variances. The new sampling designs are applied to apple production data to estimate the total apple production in Turkey.
The second part of the talk, we introduce a special design, order restricted randomized design, which uses available subjective information in a small set of experimental units to create a judgment ranked blocking factor. The design then uses a randomization scheme that relies on these subjective judgment blocks to assign the treatment levels to experimental units. Since the randomization is tied to subjective ranking of the units prior to performing the experiment, the proposed scheme fits well within the general framework of ranked set and jps sampling methodologies. On the other hand, unlike rss and jps, it uses all the units within each set with some restricted randomization to treatment combination. Such an assignment induces positive dependence among within set units, but the restrictions on randomization translate this positive dependence into a variance reduction technique. We will provide some examples with this design and discuss some logistical and practical issues in the implementation of the design.

        The ranked set sampling (RSS) was first suggested by McIntyre [Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 3:385-390, 1952] for mean estimation as efficient method compared to the well-known simple random sampling (SRS) method. Various modifications of the usual RSS since 1952 have been suggested to estimate the population parameters with some applications. This talk will be about the RSS and multistage extreme ranked set sampling (MERSS) methods (Jemain et al. 2007, 
DOI:10.3844/jmssp.2007.58.64) in estimating the population mean.

        This paper points out the importance of incorporating the latency of response in the prediction model of fruit yield. The plant does not response to the changes in the environmental factors immediately. To illustrate this, the response time of crop yield to a variety of environmental factors, including temperature, solar radiation and humidity, etc. is studied in particular. The data used in this research is collected from the field of farms so as to minimize the negative influence of the uncontrolled factors to the accuracy of statistical analysis. Five farms participating in this research are located in South Korea.

        It is well recognised that collaboration between statisticians and researchers is needed for designing a research study in which statistical reasoning can be proficiently exercised. Shiny is an R package that allows the creation of interactive web based applications without the need for other computing languages.  Non-statisticians can input parameters into a pre-programed R framework and view the results in real time.  Without the need for extended face-to-face consultations, the opportunity is enabled to guide a dialogue with field researchers through designing real-life sampling protocols, as well as to gather their expert knowledge for statistical simulations.  Such a dialogue with field researchers can be opened in a space where commonly accepted generic protocols are seldom revisited.  In this talk we are presenting an example of a Shiny app, which can also compare various sampling schemes, including balanced Ranked Set Sampling. We discuss how this approach can re-elevate the conversation about how data is gathered and alternative solutions.  We suggest that an immediate extension for this collaborative dialogue tool is to enable the user to make use of already in place data gathering automated tools. The latter, we believe will provide direct benefits to implementing RSS in the practice of field research.
