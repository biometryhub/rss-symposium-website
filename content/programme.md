        When McIntyre first proposed the innovative idea of ranked set sampling in 1952, I doubt that he had any idea of the impact it would eventually have on the field of statistical inference. There was a flurry of statistical activity immediately following his seminal paper, including derivation of some basic properties of mean estimation based on ranked set samples, and there were scattered applications of the methodology. However, it would take another thirty years of virtual dormancy in the field before the spark from Stokes and Sager (1988) would reignite interest in this novel approach to sampling. Additional methodological papers followed fast and furious and active research in the field continues today.

In this talk we briefly discuss these early efforts, but our emphasis will be on the general structure of ranked set sampling and the unique properties of statistical procedures utilizing RSS data. Seldom has a statistical concept/idea presented itself with so many interesting and unique opportunities for methodological development. In the second part of the presentation, we highlight the special features and attributes of RSS that lead to both its flexibility and its effectiveness, as well as address a few issues of concern when using this approach to sampling. We then briefly discuss a number of statistical settings where RSS procedures have been studied. In the final part of the talk, we describe some RSS-inspired offshoots that have also led to substantial research development. The full extent of the impact on statistical methodology that McIntyre inspired in 1952 is yet to be realized.

        The ranked set sampling (RSS) was first suggested by McIntyre (1952) for mean estimation as efficient method compared to the well known simple random sampling (SRS) method. Various modifications of the usual RSS since 1952 are suggested to estimate the population parameters with some applications. This talk will be about the RSS and multistage extreme ranked set sampling (MERSS) methods (Jemain et al. 2007) in estimating the population mean.

        This paper points out the importance of incorporating the latency of response in the prediction model of fruit yield. The plant does not response to the changes in the environmental factors immediately. To illustrate this, the response time of crop yield to a variety of environmental factors, including temperature, solar radiation and humidity, etc. is studied in particular. The data used in this research is collected from the field of farms so as to minimize the negative influence of the uncontrolled factors to the accuracy of statistical analysis. Five farms participating in this research are located in South Korea.
