## [Raymond Correll](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Correll)
#### Principal Statistician at Rho Environmetrics
Dr Ray Correll started his professional career as a quantitative plant ecologist working in the semi-arid zones of South Australia. He then took a position at James Cook University in Townsville in biology but found he was doing more biology as a statistician than he was as an ecologist. He undertook studies in statistics on a sabbatical leave and was offered a position as a consulting statistician in CSIRO in Adelaide – a position he held for over 30 years. Since retiring from CSIRO he has been consulting as Rho Environmetrics. Ray has a particular interest in sampling and his projects have included quarantine, water quality sampling and monitoring and soil diseases assessment. He has given courses emphasising practical applications, including quarantine, water quality sampling and monitoring and soil diseases assessment.

## [Andy Timmins](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/index.php/profile/andy.timmins)
#### Research Fellow
Andy completed a B.Sc. in biology which was followed by a Ph.D. in crop pest research and a M.Sc. in Computing Science. He spent a year working as “wet-lab” post-doc in the UK before switching careers and working in the I.T. industry as a software analyst / programmer. After several years in this role, Andy moved to Australia and pursue a career as a small-scale organic farmer. After exhausting his interest in farming, he decided to return to research at the University of Adelaide as a bioinformatician. Currently, he still works on bioinformatics projects but his interests have widened to include other areas such as machine learning and high-performance computing.

## Sharon Nielson
#### Biometrician
Sharon has been working as a biometrician (consulting statistician) for the past 17 years. She has had the privilege of working in partnership with researchers from many different discipline areas, providing statistical support and advice. During the past six years she has been researching the statistical analysis of NIR spectra – the design and analysis with linear mixed models of NIR spectra has been examined. On top of research she is currently working with SAGI-STH and operating her own statistical consulting business.

## Peter Kasprzak
#### Masters student
Following a winemaking career of 15 years both internationally and domestically, Peter came to statistics in biosciences.  After completing a  B.Mathematical Sciences (Hons) in the University of Adelaide, he joined the Biometry Hub (a research and consulting group at the Waite campus, University of Adelaide) in 2017 to undertake a M.Philosophy (Biometrics). His research is on feasibility for ranked set sampling in typical modern agronomy trials under different designs.  With an interest in computer programming, Peter is also working on developing online tools that facilitate sampling decisions for agronomists. Peter represents Young Statisticians in the Statistical Society of Australia, Southern branch, and is a member of the Research Committee of the Waite Research Institute. He is tutoring undergraduate and postgraduate statistics courses and supervises undergraduate research projects and internship in the Biometry Hub.
