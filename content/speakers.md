## [Andy Timmins](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/index.php/profile/andy.timmins)
#### Research Fellow
Andy completed a B.Sc. in biology which was followed by a Ph.D. in crop pest research and a M.Sc. in Computing Science. He spent a year working as “wet-lab” post-doc in the UK before switching careers and working in the I.T. industry as a software analyst / programmer. After several years in this role, Andy moved to Australia and pursue a career as a small-scale organic farmer. After exhausting his interest in farming, he decided to return to research at the University of Adelaide as a bioinformatician. Currently, he still works on bioinformatics projects but his interests have widened to include other areas such as machine learning and high-performance computing.

## Peter Kasprzak
#### Masters student
Following a winemaking career of 15 years both internationally and domestically, Peter came to statistics in biosciences.  After completing a  B.Mathematical Sciences (Hons) in the University of Adelaide, he joined the Biometry Hub (a research and consulting group at the Waite campus, University of Adelaide) in 2017 to undertake a M.Philosophy (Biometrics). His research is on feasibility for ranked set sampling in typical modern agronomy trials under different designs.  With an interest in computer programming, Peter is also working on developing online tools that facilitate sampling decisions for agronomists. Peter represents Young Statisticians in the Statistical Society of Australia, Southern branch, and is a member of the Research Committee of the Waite Research Institute. He is tutoring undergraduate and postgraduate statistics courses and supervises undergraduate research projects and internship in the Biometry Hub.
