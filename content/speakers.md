### Dr Olena Kravchuk
#### Head of Biometry Hub and lecturer in Applied Statistics Adelaide University.
I am interested in collaborations on three themes: 1) research on robust statistical methods, in particular the theory of rank methods, 2) research in food sensometrics, outside the consumer research, 3) applied statistics research in application to agriculture and food data. Highlights and delights of my career were several papers on rank methods followed my PhD in 2006; establishing a Food Sensory Research Unit in the University of Queensland in 2011 and collaborating for more than a decade with researchers in medical, biological and agriculture sciences. Currently I am leading a large project funded by the Grains Research and Development Corporation, Statistics for the  Australian Grains Industry in Southern Region, SAGI-STH.

### Professor You-Gan Wang
#### Chair of Applied Statistics, Centre for applications in Natural Resource Mathematics.  University of Queensland.
Professor Wangâ€™s research interests include developing statistical methodology for correlated data analysis, robust inferences and model selection and applying advanced techniques that help to solve important problems in medical sciences, environmental research and natural resource management. In applied statistics, Professor Wang has been working with multidiscipline teams on a wide range of problems. Their findings have significant impacts in resource management (fisheries and hydrology) and clinical trials (biostatistics).  Professor Wang has been invited on a number of occasions to organize/speak at international conferences and to review journal papers. His work has substantial impacts and scientific innovations in statistical modelling and data science. Professor Wang has published 140+ papers in international journals with more than 2500 SCI citations [h-index 28](http://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MNUkTMQAAAAJ&hl=en).
